# Orbut

This project was created as part of an assessment for NSS at Rancard.

## Starting the project

This project was created using **Vite + React + Typescript**. It was also styled using **Tailwind**.
To get the project up and running, use the following approach:

- Clone the project from [https://github.com/Eugene-ak/orbut.git](https://github.com/Eugene-ak/orbut.git).
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed for the project.
- Run the command `npm run dev` to spin up the development server.

The project will start on the port number `5173` and voila, you have successfully started the project. Happy hacking ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž
